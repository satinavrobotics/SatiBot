# OpenBot for Education

William Tan has developed a [curriculum](#curriculum) for economical and scalable AI and robotics education around the OpenBot software stack. It comes in the form of [step-by-step YouTube videos](#step-by-step-video-guides) which guides you through the assembly of the [OpenBot Lite](#openbot-lite-arduino), installing the necessary software, using the person following and training and deploying your own autonomous driving policy.

## OpenBot Lite

OpenBot Lite is a smaller and simplified variant of the OpenBot DIY version. This minimalist version was developed by William Tan to leverage the great potential of the OpenBot software stack for economical and scalable AI and robotics education. OpenBot Lite supports either a [micro:bit](https://microbit.org/) (+ propriotary IO board) or Ardunio Nano.

## Curriculum

The curriculum has been tested by educators in South Korea and Germany and more than 100 students have already learned about AI and robotics using this curriculum. Here are some results of our online trainings:

The policy learning is based on a 2.4m x 1.8m playfield with a street layout. The robot learns to drive autonomously on this street and avoid obstacles. This makes the curriculum ready for home-based learning.
